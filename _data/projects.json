        "longDescription": "gammaSTAR is an MRI pulse sequence development framework. gammaSTAR sequences are vendor-independent, self-contained and portable. They and can be configured to match hardware limitations and desired protocol settings after being loaded onto a device. The core logic is written in the scripting language Lua, which is easily embeddable into C/C++ frameworks, resulting in very low-footprint driver implementations. Sequences can be viewed, configured and shared through a web-technology based tool that requires no internet or network access, running completely in-browser. Sequence computation is made efficient by exploiting the underlying directed acyclic graph structure for essentially all parameter calculations. gammaSTAR is designed to enable modular sequence development and state-of-the-art MRI techniques.",

It consists of two main components: 1) a set of versatile toolboxes for image signal processing, and 2) a modular, high performance framework for streaming data processing. The streaming framework uses a client server model where the reconstruction job is performed on a server and the client is responsible for sending data and receiving imaging. Clients can be stand-alone command line clients or an imaging device could serve as a client. The framework supports easy prototyping with scripting languages such as Python while supporting transparent integration in clinical work flows. For MRI applications, the Gadgetron supports the vendor independent ISMRM Raw Data format and it comes with high performance image reconstruction pipelines for many standard MRI sequences. Example applications include Cartesian and non-Cartesian parallel imaging, non-linear reconstruction and motion correction. Several performance critical components such as the non-Cartesian Fourier transform have been implemented on GPUs for improved performance. The framework can be used as a complete reconstruction package or the toolboxes can be leveraged in other applications.",

MRiLab provides several dedicated toolboxes to analyze RF pulse, design MR sequence, configure multiple transmitting and receiving coils, investigate magnetic field related properties and evaluate real-time imaging technique. The main MRiLab simulation platform combined with those toolboxes can be applied to customize various virtual MR experiments which can serve as a prior stage for prototyping and testing new MR technique and application.</p><p>The MRiLab features highly interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for the convenience of fast experiment design and technique prototyping. High simulation accuracy is achieved by simulating discrete spin evolution at small time interval using the Bloch-equation and appropriate tissue model. In order to manipulate large multidimensional spin array, MRiLab employs parallel computing by incorporating latest graphical processing unit (GPU) technique and multi-threading CPU technique. With efficient parallelization, MRiLab can accomplish multidimensional multiple spin species MR simulation at high simulation accuracy and time efficiency, and with low computing hardware cost.</p>",

The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated 3D MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects of general MRI simulations are covered such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, non-linear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of spin motion, e.g. rigid motion, diffusion or flow. JEMRIS is written in C++ and can be used from the command line. The MR experiment configuration is done in XML format and binary I/O utilizes the HDF5 standard. For convenience JEMRIS can also be used via dedicated MATLAB graphical user interfaces. For instance, complex MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and inter-dependent modules can be modeled without any programming involved.",

The algorithm has been shown to be accurate in tissues containing between 0% and 90% fat. It is intended for use monitoring focal therapies, where heating is expected to be sparse with respect to the image volume. While it has been tested in simulation with less-sparse heating, its accuracy for widely disperse heating scenarios has not been fully validated. A numerical phantom and demo simulation is provided to guide the user in implementation of the algorithm for their own application. This algorithm was developed for research purposes and currently makes no claims of efficacy or safety for clinical implementation.",
