The visual and modular nature of GPI also allows concise communication of your work with your collaborators and provides an intuitive mechanism for others to start interacting with your research.",

It consists of two main components: 1) a set of versatile toolboxes for image signal processing, and 2) a modular, high performance framework for streaming data processing. The streaming framework uses a client server model where the reconstruction job is performed on a server and the client is responsible for sending data and receiving imaging. Clients can be stand-alone command line clients or an imaging device could serve as a client. The framework supports easy prototyping with scripting languages such as Python while supporting transparent integration in clinical work flows. For MRI applications, the Gadgetron supports the vendor independent ISMRM Raw Data format and it comes with high performance image reconstruction pipelines for many standard MRI sequences. Example applications include Cartesian and non-Cartesian parallel imaging, non-linear reconstruction and motion correction. Several performance critical components such as the non-Cartesian Fourier transform have been implemented on GPUs for improved performance. The framework can be used as a complete reconstruction package or the toolboxes can be leveraged in other applications.",

The software offers a ready-to-use interface to Matlab, similar to the well-known NUFFT Toolbox by Fessler et al., in order to seamlessly enhance the preferred Matlab prototyping process at an early stage. The gpuNUFFT supports the growing importance of non-Cartesian 2D/3D trajectories in the context of iterative image reconstruction, parallel imaging, and compressed sensing by reducing the long computation times during NUFFT operations. Depending on the data size and shape, speedups up to a factor of 40 are possible.",

The ISMRM Raw Data format is a proposal for such a common MR raw data format, which promotes algorithm and data sharing. The file format consists of a flexible header and tagged frames of k-space data. These data elements are stored in an HDF5 file container. Application Programming Interfaces are available for C/C++, MATLAB, and Python. Converters for Bruker, General Electric, Philips, and Siemens proprietary file formats also available (implemented in C++). The proposed raw data format solves a practical problem for the magnetic resonance imaging community. It may serve as a foundation for reproducible research and collaborations. The ISMRM Raw Data format is a completely open and community-driven format, and the scientific community is invited (including commercial vendors) to participate either as users or developers.",

Many aspects of general MRI simulations are covered such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, non-linear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of spin motion, e.g. rigid motion, diffusion or flow. JEMRIS is written in C++ and can be used from the command line. The MR experiment configuration is done in XML format and binary I/O utilizes the HDF5 standard. For convenience JEMRIS can also be used via dedicated MATLAB graphical user interfaces. For instance, complex MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and inter-dependent modules can be modeled without any programming involved.",
